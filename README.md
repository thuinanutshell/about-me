# Xin chào/Hello 🇻🇳

## 🎯 Career Goals
Aspiring product-driven software engineer. I am an advocate for developing technologies for social good (i.e. anything that makes education/opportunities more readily accessible to everyone and creates positive human connections and communities). I'm currently interested in data journalism (how to tell good stories about social issues using data analysis & visualization tools), knowledge management systems (the science of learning & how to make sense of complex topics), and writing :) 

## 🌱 Background
I grew up in the countryside of Central Highlands where I developed my strong passion for education and bridging the opportunity gap. I came from a social sciences background, and had never left Vietnam or written a single line of code before coming to Minerva. Now, I'm a CS major and traveling to 6 countries around the world to pursue my degree. 

## 🏆 Achievements I'm Proud Of
* I was the only first-year student interning at the newly-founded Psychology Lab at Minerva University in the summer of 2023.
* I led a team of 9 to build an education program that provides leadership training and project incubation for underprivileged students in Vietnam, which broke the organization's 5-year record for project incubation success rate, increasing from 60% to 80%.
* I was a contributing writer for a book about the perception of success, published by [Skybooks]([url](https://tiki.vn/sach-mon-qua-cua-su-that-bai-skybooks-ban-quyen-p250339005.html?spid=251585205)).
* I was the valedictorian at my high school's entrance exam and the first female student to receive a prize at the National Academic Competition (English Language category) in the school's history.
* I received the Best Delegate Award at the ASEAN-China Young Leaders' Summit 2021 - organized by the ASEAN Foundation & Peking University.
* I can make good Vietnamese food : )
