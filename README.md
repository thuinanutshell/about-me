# Xin chào/Hello 🇻🇳

# 🎯 Career Goals
Aspiring product-driven software engineer. I am an advocate for developing technologies for social good (i.e. anything that makes education/opportunities more readily accessible to everyone and creates positive human connections and communities). I'm currently interested in data journalism (how to tell good stories about social issues using data analysis & visualization tools), knowledge management systems (science of learning & how to make sense of complex topics), and writing :) 

# 🌱 Background: 
I grew up in the countryside of Central Highlands where I developed my strong passion for education and bridging the opportunity gap. I came from a social sciences background, had never left Vietnam and written a single line of code before coming to Minerva. Now, I'm a CS major and traveling to 6 countries around the world to pursue my degree.
